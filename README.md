# To-Do List App using React & Vite

This project demonstrates the development of a To-Do List application built with **React** and **Vite**. Unlike traditional setups that utilize Create React App, we chose **Vite** for its fast build times and modern development features, enhancing the overall developer experience.

## Key Highlights:
- **React**: The app is built using the latest features of React, with an emphasis on writing clean, modular, and maintainable code.
- **Vite**: We leveraged Vite as the build tool instead of Create React App, allowing for faster hot-reloading and a more streamlined development process.
- **Clean Code**: The project follows best practices in terms of code organization, naming conventions, and component structure to ensure scalability and readability.
  
## Step-by-Step Development Process

To gain a deeper understanding of the projectâ€™s evolution, please review the commit history. Each commit reflects a specific stage in the development of the application, providing insights into the incremental approach taken to build the To-Do List app.


============================================================================


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
